# NLP_ProbabilisticModels

Context: I completed these guided programming exercises during the Coursera course entitled 'Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models'.

1. C2_W1_Assignment.ipynb:
This notebook records the steps taken to build an autocorrect system based on word probabilities and presents a dynamic programming system for calculating the minimum edit distance between two strings.

2. C2_W2_Assignment.ipynb:
This notebook presents a hidden Markov model for part-of-speech tagging in terms of a transmission matrix and an emission matrix, both constructed from a corpus with smoothing. Then, it illustrates how the Viterbi algorithm can be used to predict the most likely sequence of parts of speech for a sequence of words.
